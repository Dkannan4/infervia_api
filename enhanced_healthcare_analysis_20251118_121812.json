The Department of Justice filed motions on August 29, 2025, seeking to stay the order specifically regarding the actuarial value policy while the litigation proceeds.",

This regulatory change suggests a shift in the federal government's position on HRT safety communications, potentially affecting prescribing practices, patient counseling requirements, and informed consent processes. The announcement indicates that previous warnings may have been overstated or mischaracterized, which could impact clinical guidelines and treatment protocols for menopausal women. Healthcare facilities will need to review and update their patient education materials, prescribing protocols, and risk communication strategies related to HRT.",
